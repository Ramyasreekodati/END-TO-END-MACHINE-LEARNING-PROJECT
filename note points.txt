# what is mean by setup.pu ?
It is a blueprint .It reduces the error.It uses tools like "requriments.txt" or "pyproject.toml" allowa consistent installation of dependencies.

Folders: Organize your workbooks
         (e.g., data, code, tests).
Files: Keep important notes 
        (e.g., configuration, scripts).
Tools: Have your pens ready 
        (e.g., software, libraries, virtual environments).



##Day -1 :
1.project Introduction
2. Github Repo setup
3. Project Template
4. requriments Installation (python Packages)
 
#Tools Installed:

Conda: For environment management.
Git Bash: For version control operations.
Rustinit: To handle dependencies required for some Python libraries.
Pywinpty: To ensure compatibility with Windows environments.
Process Followed:

#Environment and Tool Integration

Configured the environment path.
Linked Conda and Git Bash with Visual Studio Code.
#Repository Management

Created a new GitHub repository.
Created a local project folder on the system.

#Cloned the repository using the following steps:
    git clone <repository_url>
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git branch
    git push origin main


## Day 2:
1. Notebook Experiment
2. Project utils --> Logging, exceptions, utils module,
3. project workflows


# what is mean by Logging?
# what is mean by exceptions
# what is mean by utils module
# what is mean by workflows , why we should need it .
# how to log transform sklearn
# how to reduse skuwness
# how to create pr problem

Logging
today i have done logging where 
i have wirted code and connect the file dir and sys std output
it stored at logs
so here i created logs with code
manually i have create logging with __init__.py file in that it created __pycache__ file
i checked the process in main.py file

example:
[%(asctime)s: %(levelname)s: %(module)s: %(message)s]

[2024-11-24 05:43:44,918: INFO: main: this is y logger]


with hele of logging we don't need write the entier connent
from src.wine_quality.logging import logger
from wine_quality import logger

both will work
* it tracks the code
* it shows time level module message
* it hepls to short the import operations
